# Node Todo App

A Node app built with MongoDB and Angular.

Node (expess.js) provides the RESTful API.
Angular.js provides the frontend and accesses the API
MongoDB stores the data

## Requirements
* Docker
* A running MongoDB instance

## To build and run
```
docker build . -t express-server
docker run --net=host express-server:latest
```

Note : --net=host makes all host ports to the containers ports. This is very insecure. Don't do this in production :)


## Debugging

You will see this message if you start this container without docker-compose. docker-compose links the containers networks so they're accessible to each other. It fills in the variables with the right connection info. To resolve, start this with docker-compose up in the mean-docker folder.

```

This error means you have a mongo instance from a previous run taking up the port. You may do a ```docker-compose down``` and then ```docker-compose up``` or ```docker kill [mongo container id from docker ps]```
